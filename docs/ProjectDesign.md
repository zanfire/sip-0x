Project principle
===============================================================================

This is a SIP stack implementation. The poorhouse of this project are:
 - Playing with C++11 language and new feature
 - Create a fast and modern stack for SIP protocol that take advantage of 
   modern language feature of C++11.

The library will come with a small set of external library requirement, that 
currently are:
    - STL
    - asio

This project come with of a set of demo that would provide a set of stress test
tool using this stack.

Sip0x would be provided as header only library. NOTE: Now this library has a 
two cpp file... grrr
